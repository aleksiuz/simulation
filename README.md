# Overview

This project implements a simulation of life in a 2D world. 

1. When starting the simulation, you need to select the size of the map, from 10 to 15 cells.
2. Then the initial spawn of the creatures takes place. 
3. There are static objects: trees, rocks, grass.
4. There are dynamic objects: predators and herbivores.
5. The essence of the game is that herbivores search for and eat grass, while predators hunt for herbivores.
6. Hunger is realized, herbivores and predators can die in the absence of food.
7. Pathfinding is implemented through the BFS.
